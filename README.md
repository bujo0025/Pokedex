Final Project: Pokedex

This project is a responsive, single-page Pokédex web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Fetch API. It retrieves Pokémon data from the public PokéAPI and displays Pokémon in a dynamic, scrollable gallery that loads 20 at a time. Users can click any Pokémon to view detailed information, including artwork, types, abilities, and stats, all without page refreshes. The app also includes a catch system that allows users to mark Pokémon as “caught,” store them in local storage for persistence, and release them at any time. The interface is fully interactive, Pokémon-themed, keyboard accessible, and designed to provide a smooth and engaging browsing experience.
